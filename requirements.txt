# Notes:
# - Playwright requires an extra install step to download browser binaries.
#   After pip installs the packages, run:
#     python -m playwright install --with-deps
# - If Hugging Face Spaces uses Python 3.14 and you see Pydantic/compat warnings,
#   consider selecting a Python <=3.13 runtime for the Space or pinning affected
#   libraries until compatibility is resolved.
